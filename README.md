# Intraday TradingView + Schwabdev Bot

Version: see [`version.txt`](version.txt) · Changelog: [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) · License: MIT with Commons Clause — see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)

This README documents the **live config surface that the bot actually loads today** from `intraday_tv_schwab_bot/config.py`, plus the shipped top-level presets under `configs/` and plugin manifests under `intraday_tv_schwab_bot/_strategies/`.

Three important notes up front:

1. **Top-level block tables below show code defaults**. The strategy-by-strategy sections later in this file reflect the shipped top-level `configs/config.<strategy>.yaml` presets and matching manifest defaults that tune each bundled strategy.
2. Strategy params are split between **strategy-specific knobs** and **shared reusable groups** like anti-chase, FVG confluence, and adaptive trade management.
3. **Dashboard zoom on 1080p and lower displays**: the dashboard is laid out for 1440p+. On 1080p (or smaller), set browser zoom to **75%** so all panels fit without scrolling and chart overlays render at the intended scale. Chrome/Edge: `Ctrl + -` twice from default. Firefox: `Ctrl + -` twice, then per-domain zoom is remembered.

## Supported strategies

### Stock strategies

- `momentum_close` — late-day small-cap continuation
- `mean_reversion` — intraday pullback / rebound in strong names
- `closing_reversal` — late-day rebound setup
- `rth_trend_pullback` — all-session trend-pullback continuation
- `volatility_squeeze_breakout` — liquid-stock compression breakout strategy
- `pairs_residual` — relative-value pair divergence strategy
- `opening_range_breakout` — opening-range breakout strategy
- `peer_confirmed_key_levels` — peer-confirmed HTF key-level/zone strategy with 5-minute LTF triggers, optional macro confirmation, and ladder-aware post-entry management when `adaptive_ladder` is enabled
- `peer_confirmed_key_levels_1m` — faster 1-minute LTF peer-confirmed HTF key-level/zone variant tuned as a compromise between aggressive and balanced confirmation
- `peer_confirmed_trend_continuation` — peer-confirmed trend continuation strategy that trades controlled pullbacks and re-expansion without waiting for key-level touches
- `peer_confirmed_htf_pivots` — peer-confirmed higher-timeframe pivot S/R scalp strategy with switchable reclaim, rejection, and continuation entry families
- `top_tier_adaptive` — multi-regime adaptive strategy for top-tier liquid stocks across six Tier 1 GICS sectors with index confirmation and sector concentration guard; six core regimes (trend, pullback, range, vol_squeeze, momentum, sr_scalp) compete in a flat score-ordered build queue, plus a dedicated `orb` opening-range-breakout regime in the opening window
- `small_cap_squeeze` — long-only multi-regime small-cap "squeeze" strategy; a dynamic TradingView screener (low float 400K-20M, premarket gap ≥5% on heavy volume, RVOL ≥2) replaces the fixed list. Reuses the `top_tier_adaptive` engine (trend/pullback/range/vol_squeeze/momentum + opt-in `vwap_reclaim`; ORB and sr_scalp off), 1-minute LTF, premarket/extended-hours eligible

### 0DTE ETF option strategies

- `zero_dte_etf_options` — defined-risk vertical spread mode
- `zero_dte_etf_long_options` — long-premium calls / puts only

## Running

Requires **Python 3.11+**. Install dependencies (strictly pinned in `requirements.txt`), seed a runtime config, and launch:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp configs/config.example.yaml configs/config.yaml
python main.py --config configs/config.yaml --strategy zero_dte_etf_options
```

Alternatively, `pip install -e .` consumes `pyproject.toml` and registers the
`intraday-tv-schwab-bot` console script. The package version is pulled from
`version.txt` at the repo root and exposed as `intraday_tv_schwab_bot.__version__`.

`requirements.txt` pins `TA-Lib==0.6.8`, which backs the standard indicator and candlestick-pattern layer. On Windows, `pip install TA-Lib==0.6.8` is self-contained — the 0.6.x wheels on PyPI statically bundle the underlying C library (cp39–cp313, win_amd64). On macOS and Linux, install the native C library first (`brew install ta-lib` on macOS, `apt install libta-lib0-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu) before `pip install`.

Tests are maintained in a private source tree (not shipped with this repository).

Change `--strategy` or the top-level `strategy:` key to switch strategies.

Runtime config precedence is now intentionally simple:

- manifest/code defaults
- the selected top-level YAML file (for example `configs/config.peer_confirmed_htf_pivots.yaml`)
- CLI strategy override via `--strategy`


For runtime plugin behavior, the engine now prefers strategy hooks and manifest capabilities over hard-coded strategy-name branches. The most common extension points are `dashboard_tradable_symbols()`, `restore_eligible_symbols()`, `requires_hybrid_startup_restore_metadata()`, `signal_priority_key(...)`, `dashboard_candidate_limit()`, `dashboard_allow_generic_level_fallback()`, `dashboard_level_context_spec()`, `dashboard_candidate_label()`, `dashboard_candidate_sources()`, `active_watchlist(...)`, and `quote_watchlist(...)`. New plugins can now often declare those behaviors in `manifest.json` under `capabilities`, including watchlist/quote universe rules and dashboard level-context overrides, and only fall back to Python hooks when they need something more custom.

The standardized plugin runtime contract now uses `Candidate.activity_score`, `Candidate.directional_bias`, and signal metadata fields such as `final_priority_score`, `selection_quality_score`, `activity_score`, `setup_quality_score`, and `execution_quality_score`.

`manifest.json` now supports `schema_version: 1`, and the loader rejects unsupported top-level keys early so malformed plugins fail closer to the source of the mistake. New plugins are fully self-contained: the scaffold emits plain-string `strategy_name` values, and no central strategy-name helper or `models.py` edit is required.

A scaffold helper is included for new plugins. It clones `configs/config.example.yaml` as a full runnable preset, swaps in the new strategy name, and writes `configs/config.<strategy>.yaml`:

```bash
python scripts/scaffold_strategy_plugin.py my_new_strategy
```

A basic plugin conformance test suite also ships under `tests/test_strategy_plugin_conformance.py`.

## How the YAML is organized

The top-level blocks are:

- `strategy`
- `schwab`
- `tradingview`
- `risk`
- `runtime`
- `execution`
- `candles`
- `chart_patterns`
- `paper`
- `dashboard`
- `support_resistance`
- `technical_levels`
- `shared_entry`
- `shared_exit`
- `options`
- `pairs`

Times are interpreted in `runtime.timezone`, which defaults to `America/New_York`.

Use the selected top-level config file as the single runtime source of truth. Shipped presets live under `configs/config.<strategy>.yaml`.

## Top-level config reference

### `strategy`

The active strategy name.

Valid values:

- `momentum_close`
- `mean_reversion`
- `closing_reversal`
- `rth_trend_pullback`
- `volatility_squeeze_breakout`
- `pairs_residual`
- `opening_range_breakout`
- `zero_dte_etf_options`
- `zero_dte_etf_long_options`
- `peer_confirmed_key_levels`
- `peer_confirmed_key_levels_1m`
- `peer_confirmed_trend_continuation`
- `peer_confirmed_htf_pivots`
- `top_tier_adaptive`
- `small_cap_squeeze`

Changing `strategy` switches the live strategy only. The standard example/main config is now a full runnable template and includes an explicit `strategies.<name>` block. Shipped full presets do the same so each preset is portable as a standalone runtime config. The selected top-level file is now the runtime authority for `strategies.<name>`.

### Secrets via `.env`

Schwab API credentials and the TradingView session cookie are sourced from a `.env` file at the repo root so they never have to live in a committed yaml config.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (both files are at the repo root).
2. Fill in the real values:
   - `SCHWAB_APP_KEY` and `SCHWAB_APP_SECRET` — required; obtained from your Schwab developer app.
   - `SCHWAB_ACCOUNT_HASH` — optional; set only if you want to pin trading to a specific linked account. Leave blank to auto-resolve.
   - `SCHWAB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` — optional (strongly recommended); Fernet key that encrypts the Schwab token DB at rest. Generate with `python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"` and paste the 44-char base64 output into `.env`.
   - `TRADINGVIEW_SESSIONID` — optional; grab the `sessionid` cookie from a logged-in TradingView browser session.
3. `.env` is listed in `.gitignore`, so the file stays local to your machine.

Resolution precedence when the bot loads a config:

1. A real value in the yaml (`schwab.app_key`, `schwab.app_secret`, `schwab.account_hash`, `schwab.encryption`, `tradingview.sessionid`) always wins. Placeholder strings like `YOUR_APP_KEY` are treated as unset.
2. Otherwise the matching environment variable is used (`SCHWAB_APP_KEY`, `SCHWAB_APP_SECRET`, `SCHWAB_ACCOUNT_HASH`, `SCHWAB_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `TRADINGVIEW_SESSIONID`).
3. If the env var isn't set in the real process environment, the value is read from `.env` (process env always wins over `.env`).
4. If neither yaml nor env provides the Schwab key or secret, `load_config` raises with a clear error pointing at `.env.example`. `account_hash`, `encryption`, and `sessionid` are optional; the bot runs without them (`encryption` unset means tokens are stored unencrypted).

The `.env` parser is intentionally minimal (no `python-dotenv` dependency): one `KEY=VALUE` per line, `#` for comments, optional surrounding quotes.

### `schwab`

Use this block for broker auth, token storage, and dry-run behavior.

| Option         | Code default            |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| `app_key`      | `REQUIRED` (via `.env`) |
| `app_secret`   | `REQUIRED` (via `.env`) |
| `callback_url` | `https://127.0.0.1`     |
| `tokens_db`    | `.schwabdev/tokens.db`  |
| `encryption`   | `null` (via `.env`)     |
| `timeout`      | `10`                    |
| `account_hash` | `null` (via `.env`)     |
| `dry_run`      | `true`                  |

How these fields behave:

- `app_key` / `app_secret`: required Schwab developer credentials. Supply via the `.env` file at the repo root (`SCHWAB_APP_KEY`, `SCHWAB_APP_SECRET`) — see [Secrets via `.env`](#secrets-via-env). Setting them in this yaml block is still honored and overrides `.env`, but keeping them out of yaml avoids committing credentials.
- `callback_url`: OAuth callback URL registered with Schwab.
- `tokens_db`: local token-store path.
- `encryption`: Fernet key that encrypts the token DB at rest. Supply via the `.env` file (`SCHWAB_ENCRYPTION_KEY`) — see [Secrets via `.env`](#secrets-via-env). Leave unset (null/blank) to leave the DB unencrypted. Generate a key with: `python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"`.
- `timeout`: HTTP timeout in seconds for Schwab calls.
- `account_hash`: explicit account hash. Supply via the `.env` file (`SCHWAB_ACCOUNT_HASH`) when you need to pin trading to a specific linked account — see [Secrets via `.env`](#secrets-via-env). Leave unset (null/blank) to auto-resolve the linked account.
- `dry_run`: when `true`, simulate broker actions instead of sending live orders.

### `tradingview`

This block is used by stock strategies and by the 0DTE ETF screen/ranker.

| Option                     | Code default        |
|----------------------------|---------------------|
| `sessionid`                | `null` (via `.env`) |
| `market`                   | `america`           |
| `max_candidates`           | `5`                 |
| `screener_refresh_seconds` | `90`                |
| `min_market_cap`           | `30000000`          |
| `max_market_cap`           | `2000000000`        |
| `min_volume`               | `750000`            |
| `min_value_traded_1m`      | `150000.0`          |
| `min_volume_1m`            | `25000`             |

Behavior and valid values:

- `sessionid`: TradingView session cookie. Supply via the `.env` file (`TRADINGVIEW_SESSIONID`) — see [Secrets via `.env`](#secrets-via-env). Leaving it unset (null) is allowed; screener results may be delayed ~15 minutes without it.
- `market`: TradingView screener market namespace. Typical value: `america`.
- `max_candidates`: max candidates kept after each screener refresh. Higher values widen the watchlist.
- `screener_refresh_seconds`: TradingView screener cache life. Lower values refresh the screen more often.
- `min_market_cap` / `max_market_cap`: market-cap bounds for stock screeners.
- `min_volume`: minimum daily share volume for stock screening.
- `min_value_traded_1m`: minimum one-minute dollar value. Higher values force cleaner intrabar liquidity.
- `min_volume_1m`: minimum one-minute share volume. Higher values also make the screener more selective.

### `risk`

This block controls shared position sizing, daily guardrails, re-entry behavior, and open-trade management mode.

| Option                            | Code default      |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------|
| `max_positions`                   | `2`               |
| `risk_per_trade_frac_of_notional` | `0.004`           |
| `max_notional_per_trade`          | `4000.0`          |
| `max_total_notional`              | `8000.0`          |
| `max_daily_loss`                  | `400.0`           |
| `default_stop_pct`                | `0.018`           |
| `default_target_pct`              | `0.038`           |
| `trailing_stop_pct`               | `0.014`           |
| `trade_management_mode`           | `adaptive_ladder` |
| `allow_short`                     | `false`           |
| `cooldown_minutes`                | `20`              |
| `reentry_policy`                  | `cooldown`        |
| `cooldown_direction_aware`        | `true`            |
| `same_level_block_minutes`        | `30`              |
| `same_level_block_atr_mult`       | `0.3`             |
| `time_stop_minutes`               | `45`              |
| `time_stop_min_return_pct`        | `0.003`           |
| `peak_giveback_enabled`           | `true`            |
| `peak_giveback_min_r`             | `1.0`             |

Behavior and valid values:

- `max_positions`: max simultaneous open bot positions.
- `risk_per_trade_frac_of_notional`: risk budget as a **fraction of `max_notional_per_trade`** (not of account equity). Dollar risk per trade = `max_notional_per_trade × risk_per_trade_frac_of_notional`. Example: with `max_notional_per_trade: 16000` and `risk_per_trade_frac_of_notional: 0.008`, each trade risks at most **$128** (16000 × 0.008). Raising `max_notional_per_trade` raises the dollar risk budget proportionally.
- `max_notional_per_trade`: hard cap on one stock position's notional size.
- `max_total_notional`: cap across all open stock positions.
- `max_daily_loss`: daily stop-trading threshold in account currency.
- `default_stop_pct` / `default_target_pct`: fallback stock stop/target distances when a strategy does not derive its own levels.
- `trailing_stop_pct`: base trailing-stop fraction used only by `adaptive`, and by `adaptive_ladder` when the active strategy does not emit ladder metadata. Smaller values trail tighter; larger values give trades more room.
- `trade_management_mode`: valid values are `adaptive`, `adaptive_ladder`, `sr_flip`, or `none`. These modes control equity-style post-entry management. Option strategies continue to use their own fixed stop/target and session-flatten logic.
  - `adaptive`: use the newer R-multiple-based management layer, including adaptive runner extension and base trailing-stop behavior.
  - `sr_flip`: use support/resistance flip management only. Generic adaptive and trailing-stop management are disabled in this mode.
  - `adaptive_ladder`: for ladder-enabled strategies, keep adaptive breakeven/profit-lock protection available, but let ladder promotion own target advancement and structural stop ratcheting. Generic runner target extension and generic trailing-stop management are suppressed for ladder-enabled trades. Strategies that do not emit ladder metadata automatically fall back to normal adaptive behavior.
  - `none`: disable adaptive, ladder, S/R flip, and generic trailing-stop management. Only the fixed stop/target exit levels remain active.
- `allow_short`: enables short equity entries for strategies that support them.
- `cooldown_minutes`: only used when `reentry_policy: cooldown`.
- `reentry_policy`: valid values are `cooldown`, `immediate`, or `rest_of_day`.
  - `cooldown`: block re-entry for `cooldown_minutes` after exit.
  - `immediate`: allow same-symbol re-entry immediately.
  - `rest_of_day`: block re-entry until the next trading day.
- `cooldown_direction_aware`: when `true` (the recommended default), the cooldown is keyed by `(symbol, side)` — a LONG exit on `NVDA` only blocks LONG re-entries on `NVDA`; a SHORT can still fire immediately if a genuine bearish setup develops. When `false`, the cooldown blocks both directions on the symbol for the full `cooldown_minutes` window. Has no effect under `reentry_policy: immediate` or `rest_of_day`.
- `same_level_block_minutes`: after a stop-out, block **same-direction** re-entry on the same symbol for this many minutes. Targets the breakout-chase pattern where the bot enters → stops → re-enters at the same level → stops again. Set to `0` to disable. Independent of `cooldown_minutes`; both blocks apply.
- `same_level_block_atr_mult`: the same-level block only fires when the new entry sits within `same_level_block_atr_mult × ATR` of the prior stop price. Lower values block a tighter price band around the prior stop; higher values widen it. Fib-pullback entries (where the new entry sits in the [0.5, 0.786] retracement zone of a tagged anchor) override the block.
- `time_stop_minutes`: scratch-exit a trade held this long with `|return_pct| < time_stop_min_return_pct`. Targets dead-capital trades that aren't moving. Set to `0` to disable.
- `time_stop_min_return_pct`: the absolute return threshold under which the time-stop fires (e.g. `0.003` = 0.3%). Trades outside this band aren't time-stopped regardless of duration.
- `peak_giveback_enabled`: when `true`, fires `peak_giveback:peakXR_floorYR` once `max_favorable_r` crosses `peak_giveback_min_r` and `current_r` retraces past a tiered floor (50% at 1R peak, 40% at 2R, 30% at 3R+). Complements the protective-BE logic at +0.5R: BE catches 0.5–1R winners, peak-giveback catches 1R+ runners that give back too much.
- `peak_giveback_min_r`: minimum peak R-multiple before the peak-giveback floor activates. Set to `0` together with `peak_giveback_enabled: false` to disable entirely.

### `runtime`

This block controls loop timing, quote/history refresh cadence, stream fallback behavior, startup reconciliation, and log/state paths.

Behavior and valid values:

- `timezone`: IANA timezone string. All configured times are interpreted in this timezone.
- `loop_sleep_seconds`: base engine sleep between iterations.
- `history_poll_seconds`: cadence for history refreshes.
- `quote_poll_seconds`: cadence for quote refreshes when polling is used.
- `quote_cache_seconds`: max age of cached quotes before forcing a refresh.
- `quote_batch_size`: max symbols grouped into one quote request.
- `history_lookback_minutes`: intraday history depth retained for signal generation.
- `use_extended_hours_history`: include premarket/after-hours minute bars in warmup and backfill.
  - **Overnight ECN data lag (Schwab API).** Even with `use_extended_hours_history: true`, Schwab's `price_history` minute endpoint does **not** include bars for the most recent weekday overnight (~8:00 PM ET → 7:00 AM ET) at any frequency (verified at `frequency=1`, `5`, `15`, and `30`). Those overnight ECN bars become available with roughly a 1-trading-day lag — older overnights (e.g. `Wed 8 PM → Thu 7 AM`) do return continuous bars at all frequencies once they've aged. The Sunday → Monday transition is an exception: weekend ECN bars are released without the lag and appear immediately under Sunday's evening startDate.
  - **Visual consequence on the dashboard chart.** The LTF chart's window covers ~30 trading hours at most (`tail(360 × ltf_minutes)`); the most recent overnight gap dominates the visible range until Schwab fills it in. The HTF chart spans 5+ weeks at `60m × 360`, so older overnights with the lag already resolved fill the chart and the gap is barely visible. The **underlying data has the same gap in both timeframes** — only the visible-window-vs-data-density ratio differs. This is a Schwab data-availability constraint, not a bot pipeline bug; nothing is filtering bars in the bot itself.
  - **No fix planned.** Fetching directly at coarser minute frequencies (`5`/`15`/`30`) doesn't help — they all share the same lag for the most recent overnight. Extending `history_lookback_minutes` past 24h would eventually pick up overnight bars on heal fetches once Schwab releases them, but at the cost of larger fetch payloads on every heal. Current design keeps `history_lookback_minutes: 780` (13h) and accepts that the freshest overnight is invisible on the LTF chart.
- `use_rth_session_indicators`: use regular-session-only EMA/VWAP during RTH, while premarket and postmarket continue using all-session indicator values.
- Screener queries are session-aware: canonical `close`, `change_from_open`, and `volume` map to `premarket_*` fields before 09:30 ET, regular-session fields during RTH, and `postmarket_*` fields after 16:00 ET. Returned screener rows are normalized back to the canonical column names so strategy code keeps reading `close`, `change_from_open`, and `volume` consistently across sessions.
- `warmup_minutes`: minimum history seeded when a symbol is first watched. The bot now also respects each strategy's required bar warmup and will request a deeper preload when the active strategy needs more bars than the current session has provided yet.
- Startup before premarket history is available now schedules a one-shot retry at **7:01 AM ET** for that session, so aliases/index-like symbols can recover promptly once Schwab starts serving candles.
- Dashboard/API state now includes a `warmup` summary and per-symbol readiness payloads so the UI can show `Not Ready`, `Loading`, and `Ready` without digging through skip logs.
- `prewarm_before_windows_minutes`: outside all active windows, skip routine refresh work until the next active window is this close.
- `log_dir`: log/state directory.
- `stream_fields`: Schwab stream field IDs to subscribe to.
- `stream_connect_timeout_seconds`: how long to wait for the stream to come up before treating it as unavailable.
- `stream_fallback_poll_seconds`: polling cadence when streaming is unavailable.
- `stream_stale_fallback_seconds`: base regular-session stale-stream threshold. For 1-minute `CHART_EQUITY`, the live stale check is floored by the stream-health policy (currently about 130 seconds) so healthy minute-close streams do not false-fallback every loop.
- `stream_health_log_seconds`: throttle interval for stream-health logging.
- `reconcile_on_startup`: whether to inspect broker positions/orders at startup.
- `startup_reconcile_mode`: valid values are `ignore`, `block`, `log_only`, `restore_basic`, `restore_hybrid`.
  - `ignore`: skip startup reconciliation entirely.
  - `block`: block new entries if broker positions / working orders are found.
  - `log_only`: log findings but do not block.
  - `restore_basic`: restore broker stock positions into bot memory without metadata help.
  - `restore_hybrid`: restore broker stock positions and also consult the metadata SQLite store for richer restore state.
- `startup_order_lookback_days`: broker order lookup window used during startup reconciliation.
- `startup_reconcile_ignore_symbols`: symbol list ignored during startup reconcile. Ignored open symbols are still blocked from new entries.
- `startup_reconcile_metadata_db_path`: SQLite metadata path used by hybrid restore.
- `auto_exit_after_session`: when `true`, the bot shuts down cleanly after the trading session ends and all positions are closed. Exits after the latest of RTH close and any configured strategy window end. On non-trading days (weekends/holidays), exits immediately. Designed for use with Windows Task Scheduler or cron to start the bot daily.
- `idle_sleep_seconds`: outside the 7am–8pm ET equity stream window (when neither streaming nor order acceptance is available), the loop sleeps this long between iterations instead of `loop_sleep_seconds`. Cuts overnight CPU waste by ~95% on always-on bots — the loop wakes every minute by default to recheck whether streaming has resumed instead of every 2s. Set to a value `<= loop_sleep_seconds` to disable the optimization entirely.
- `symbol_state_prune_seconds`: cadence at which the engine evicts per-symbol state (history frames, HTF/SR caches, dashboard snapshot/chart payloads) for symbols that have dropped out of the active set (streamed symbols + last watchlist + open positions). Long-running multi-day bots otherwise accumulate history dicts (~240KB per 1m frame at default lookback) for every symbol the screener has ever returned. Set to `0` to disable pruning entirely.
- `session_reconcile_on_resume`: when `true`, the engine re-runs the startup reconcile at the first cycle on each new ET trading day where streaming is back online (i.e., the first cycle past 7am ET). Catches positions that closed overnight via the Schwab app or broker-side stops — without this, an always-on bot would wake at 7am still believing those positions are open and try to manage phantoms. Honors the same `reconcile_on_startup` and `startup_reconcile_mode` knobs as the startup reconcile (no separate mode). Set to `false` to disable if you handle reconciliation externally or only run single-day sessions.
- `cycle_precompute_workers`: thread-pool size used to precompute per-symbol indicator/structure context in parallel each engine cycle. Higher values reduce per-cycle latency on wide watchlists at the cost of CPU; lower values trade latency for less contention.
- Cycle-scoped broker positions cache: `account_details` is fetched at most once per `step()` regardless of how many `broker_position_row` / `broker_position_rows` consumers (entry gatekeeper + exit recovery in position manager) run inside the cycle. Eliminates the N-fetches-per-cycle redundancy when many signals or positions overlap; failure latches per-cycle to avoid retry storms during Schwab outages. Mirrors the per-cycle FVG/OB/S-R caches in `data_feed.py`.
- `max_consecutive_quote_failures`: per-symbol quote-fetch failure threshold. After a symbol fails this many consecutive quote refreshes (typically symbol-specific Schwab 401/403/404 such as restricted-security responses), it is silenced from quote refresh for the rest of the session. The counter resets on any successful fetch; the blacklist clears on bot restart. Set to `0` to disable (always retry — pre-2026-04-29 behavior). The default `5` catches symbol-specific permission errors without triggering on transient hiccups. Other endpoints (history, stream) for the same symbol are unaffected.
- `export_session_archive`: when `true`, the engine writes a per-day archive to `{log_dir}/sessions/{YYYY-MM-DD}/` containing `bars/{SYMBOL}.csv` for every active watchlist symbol (RTH only, with indicators), `trades.csv` filtered to the day, and `manifest.json` with strategy + summary stats. The archive fires automatically once per ET trading day after the stream window closes (8 PM ET), so an always-on bot produces one archive per session without waiting for shutdown; shutdown still writes its own (potentially overwriting today's bundle with a fresher snapshot). Useful for trade audits and post-session analysis. Disable to save disk space if running without dashboard/analysis needs.

### Session report

When the bot shuts down (auto-exit, manual interrupt, or non-trading day), it writes an end-of-session summary along five analytical axes so you can tune strategies and configs from the log:

- **Log summary**: `SESSION REPORT <date>: strategy=... pnl=... trades=... wins=... losses=... win_rate=... pf=... avg_trade=... max_drawdown=...` followed by a per-trade breakdown.
- **Aggregate tables** (human-readable, in the log):
  - **Per regime** — count, wins/losses, net PnL, avg PnL, win rate, best, worst per regime (trend / pullback / range / ...)
  - **Per symbol** — same columns aggregated by ticker — surfaces concentration issues and high-variance names
  - **Per exit reason** — same columns aggregated by exit reason (normalized: `resistance_break_exit:311.59` rolls up into `resistance_break_exit`) — flags leaky exits
  - **Per hour (entry)** — same columns bucketed by entry hour (ET) — identifies dead zones in the trading day
  - **MAE/MFE** — max adverse and max favorable excursion in R-multiples (`avg_MAE=0.26R avg_MFE=0.39R max_MAE=1.33R`) plus heat/runup threshold hits (`trades>1R_heat=N`, `trades>2R_runup=N`) — surfaces stops that are too tight or exits that leave profit on the table
  - **Filter rejections** — tally of each skip reason the engine logged, top 10 shown (`cooldown: 175 / short_no_qualifying_regime: 89 / htf_bias_bearish: 12 / ...`) — shows which filters did the most work and whether any are over- or under-firing
- **Structured JSON**: `SESSION_REPORT {...}` at TRADEFLOW level. Carries the same aggregates as first-class keys: `per_regime`, `per_symbol`, `per_exit_reason`, `per_hour`, `mae_mfe`, `filter_rejections`. Any downstream tool (dashboard, spreadsheet import, analyzer) can consume it directly without scraping the human log.
- **Persistent CSV**: `.logs/trades.csv` — one row per closed trade, appended across sessions. Columns: `date, symbol, strategy, side, qty, entry_price, exit_price, entry_time, exit_time, realized_pnl, return_pct, hold_minutes, reason, asset_type, partial_exit, fill_price_estimated, broker_recovered, regime, initial_risk_per_unit, max_favorable_pnl, max_adverse_pnl, entry_slippage_pct`.

The CSV file accumulates over time — open it in Excel or load with `pd.read_csv(".logs/trades.csv")` for multi-day analysis.

**Schema rotation** — if the CSV column set ever changes (e.g., after an upgrade that adds diagnostic columns), the existing file is rotated to `.logs/trades.archive-<date>.csv` and a fresh `.logs/trades.csv` is started with the new header. A WARNING is logged so the operator sees the rotation. Historical data is preserved in the archive file.

### `execution`

This block controls how equity orders are priced and managed after submission.

| Option                            | Code default |
|-----------------------------------|--------------|
| `entry_limit_min_buffer`          | `0.03`       |
| `entry_limit_max_buffer`          | `0.05`       |
| `entry_limit_spread_frac`         | `0.1`        |
| `entry_live_fill_timeout_seconds` | `3.0`        |
| `entry_live_poll_seconds`         | `0.5`        |
| `entry_live_reprice_attempts`     | `1`          |
| `entry_live_reprice_step_frac`    | `0.5`        |
| `extended_hours_enabled`          | `true`       |
| `market_exit_regular_hours`       | `true`       |

Behavior and valid values:

- `entry_limit_min_buffer` / `entry_limit_max_buffer`: lower and upper limit-price offsets used for marketable-limit stock entries.
- `entry_limit_spread_frac`: spread fraction used when converting the current quote into a limit price.
- `entry_live_fill_timeout_seconds`: how long to wait for an equity entry fill before cancel/reprice logic can kick in.
- `entry_live_poll_seconds`: polling interval while waiting on an equity entry.
- `entry_live_reprice_attempts`: number of live reprice attempts before giving up.
- `entry_live_reprice_step_frac`: size of each reprice step as a fraction of the entry buffer.
- `extended_hours_enabled`: allow equity orders outside regular hours when the broker permits it.
- `market_exit_regular_hours`: when `true`, stock exits during regular hours can use market orders.

### `candles`

Candlestick pattern filters used by stock strategies and some shared confluence logic. The shipped candle engine only evaluates the latest **3 bars**, so only **1-bar, 2-bar, and 3-bar** patterns are registered.

| Option                         | Code default                                 |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `bullish_patterns`             | `['bullish_1c', 'bullish_2c', 'bullish_3c']` |
| `bearish_patterns`             | `['bearish_1c', 'bearish_2c', 'bearish_3c']` |
| `opposing_net_score_threshold` | `0.70`                                       |

Valid pattern tokens use the exact TA-Lib candlestick function names, plus group shortcuts:

- Group shortcuts: `bullish_1c`, `bullish_2c`, `bullish_3c`, `bearish_1c`, `bearish_2c`, `bearish_3c`, `all`
- Bullish 1c: `CDLDRAGONFLYDOJI`, `CDLHAMMER`, `CDLINVERTEDHAMMER`, `CDLTAKURI`, `CDLBELTHOLD`, `CDLCLOSINGMARUBOZU`, `CDLLONGLINE`, `CDLMARUBOZU`
- Bearish 1c: `CDLGRAVESTONEDOJI`, `CDLHANGINGMAN`, `CDLSHOOTINGSTAR`, `CDLBELTHOLD`, `CDLCLOSINGMARUBOZU`, `CDLLONGLINE`, `CDLMARUBOZU`
- Bullish 2c: `CDLHOMINGPIGEON`, `CDLMATCHINGLOW`, `CDLPIERCING`, `TWEEZER_BOTTOM`, `CDLCOUNTERATTACK`, `CDLDOJISTAR`, `CDLENGULFING`, `CDLHARAMI`, `CDLHARAMICROSS`, `CDLKICKING`, `CDLKICKINGBYLENGTH`, `CDLSEPARATINGLINES`
- Bearish 2c: `CDLDARKCLOUDCOVER`, `CDLINNECK`, `CDLONNECK`, `CDLTHRUSTING`, `TWEEZER_TOP`, `CDLCOUNTERATTACK`, `CDLDOJISTAR`, `CDLENGULFING`, `CDLHARAMI`, `CDLHARAMICROSS`, `CDLKICKING`, `CDLKICKINGBYLENGTH`, `CDLSEPARATINGLINES`
- Bullish 3c: `CDL3STARSINSOUTH`, `CDL3WHITESOLDIERS`, `CDLMORNINGDOJISTAR`, `CDLMORNINGSTAR`, `CDLSTICKSANDWICH`, `CDLUNIQUE3RIVER`, `CDL3INSIDE`, `CDL3OUTSIDE`, `CDLABANDONEDBABY`, `CDLGAPSIDESIDEWHITE`, `CDLHIKKAKE`, `CDLTASUKIGAP`, `CDLTRISTAR`, `CDLXSIDEGAP3METHODS`
- Bearish 3c: `CDL2CROWS`, `CDL3BLACKCROWS`, `CDLADVANCEBLOCK`, `CDLEVENINGDOJISTAR`, `CDLEVENINGSTAR`, `CDLIDENTICAL3CROWS`, `CDLSTALLEDPATTERN`, `CDLUPSIDEGAP2CROWS`, `CDL3INSIDE`, `CDL3OUTSIDE`, `CDLABANDONEDBABY`, `CDLGAPSIDESIDEWHITE`, `CDLHIKKAKE`, `CDLTASUKIGAP`, `CDLTRISTAR`, `CDLXSIDEGAP3METHODS`

Behavior:

- `bullish_patterns`: list of bullish candlestick patterns allowed for bullish pattern checks.
- `bearish_patterns`: list of bearish candlestick patterns allowed for bearish pattern checks.
- `opposing_net_score_threshold`: minimum opposing `net_score` required for `shared_entry.use_opposing_candle_filter` to block an entry or `shared_exit.use_candle_pattern_exit` to fire. `0.70` matches the "solid" confirm tier (≥2 corroborating candles); raise toward `1.0` for strong-only, lower for more aggressive filtering.
- Using a shorter list makes the bot more selective.
- Using `all` enables every registered pattern on that side.
- Candle groups stay underscore-only, while individual candle names use exact TA-Lib `CDL...` names plus the custom `TWEEZER_TOP` / `TWEEZER_BOTTOM` tokens.
- The weighted candle summary treats **3-bar > 2-bar > 1-bar**, uses the strongest same-side hit as the anchor, adds only a small corroboration bonus for extra same-side hits, and penalizes conflicting opposite-side hits instead of fully stacking overlaps.
- Presets that are candle-driven now ship with all `1c/2c/3c` groups enabled, while presets for strategies that do not consume candle logic directly leave those lists empty.

### `chart_patterns`

Intraday structure / chart-pattern detection used as entry filters, confluence, and exits.

| Option                  | Code default                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `enabled`               | `true`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `lookback_bars`         | `32`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `bullish_patterns`      | `['bullish_double_bottom', 'bullish_inverse_head_and_shoulders', 'bullish_falling_wedge', 'bullish_broadening_bottom', 'bullish_triple_bottom', 'bullish_flag', 'bullish_pennant', 'bullish_ascending_triangle', 'bullish_symmetrical_triangle']` |
| `bearish_patterns`      | `['bearish_double_top', 'bearish_head_and_shoulders', 'bearish_rising_wedge', 'bearish_broadening_top', 'bearish_triple_top', 'bearish_flag', 'bearish_pennant', 'bearish_descending_triangle', 'bearish_symmetrical_triangle']`                  |

Valid pattern tokens:

- Bullish patterns: `bullish_ascending_triangle`, `bullish_broadening_bottom`, `bullish_double_bottom`, `bullish_falling_wedge`, `bullish_flag`, `bullish_inverse_head_and_shoulders`, `bullish_pennant`, `bullish_symmetrical_triangle`, `bullish_triple_bottom`
- Bearish patterns: `bearish_broadening_top`, `bearish_descending_triangle`, `bearish_double_top`, `bearish_flag`, `bearish_head_and_shoulders`, `bearish_pennant`, `bearish_rising_wedge`, `bearish_symmetrical_triangle`, `bearish_triple_top`
- Group shortcuts: `bullish`, `bullish_reversal`, `bullish_continuation`, `bullish_all`, `bearish`, `bearish_reversal`, `bearish_continuation`, `bearish_all`, `all`

Behavior:

- `enabled`: master on/off for chart-pattern detection.
- `lookback_bars`: bars inspected when scanning for patterns.
- `bullish_patterns` / `bearish_patterns`: allowed pattern lists. Shorter lists make the filter narrower.
- Entry/exit toggles for opposing-pattern gating live in `shared_entry.use_opposing_chart_filter` and `shared_exit.use_chart_pattern_exit`.

### `paper`

Paper-account storage and dashboard-history settings.

| Option              | Code default |
|---------------------|--------------|
| `starting_equity`   | `25000.0`    |
| `max_equity_points` | `2000`       |
| `max_trade_history` | `200`        |

Behavior:

- `starting_equity`: starting paper-equity balance used in dry-run/paper mode. In live mode, the dashboard tracked-capital baseline uses `max_total_notional` and is labeled `Allocated Capital`.
- `max_equity_points`: max equity-curve points retained for the dashboard.
- `max_trade_history`: max closed trades kept in the paper account history.

### `dashboard`

Controls the local dashboard server and its charting profiles.

| Option         | Code default                 |
|----------------|------------------------------|
| `enabled`      | `true`                       |
| `host`         | `127.0.0.1`                  |
| `port`         | `8765`                       |
| `refresh_ms`   | `2000`                       |
| `state_path`   | `.logs/dashboard_state.json` |
| `theme`        | `default`                    |
| `https`        | `false`                      |
| `ssl_certfile` | `""`                         |
| `ssl_keyfile`  | `""`                         |

Behavior:

- `enabled`: turn the dashboard server on or off.
- `host` / `port`: bind address and port.
- `refresh_ms`: browser refresh interval in milliseconds.
- `state_path`: JSON state snapshot used by the dashboard.
- `theme`: dashboard theme. Set to the folder name of any theme under `intraday_tv_schwab_bot/dashboard_assets/themes/`. Shipped themes:
  - `default` — blue-tinted dark with glow gradients (the original look).
  - `dark` — pure black background with translucent glass panels and subtle white edge lighting.
  - `light` — clean white background with light panels and dark text.
  - `nexus` — near-black with mint/teal accent, soft radial glows.
  - `solstice` — near-black with warm amber/coral accent.
  - `nebula` — near-black with violet/purple accent.
  - `example_custom` — starter template showing how to build a fully custom dashboard (see "Custom themes" below).

  If the configured theme folder is missing or the name is malformed, the server logs a warning and falls back to `default`. Chart colors are not affected by theme tokens.

##### Custom themes

Themes are plugin folders. Drop `intraday_tv_schwab_bot/dashboard_assets/themes/<your_name>/` in place and set `dashboard.theme: <your_name>` in config. The folder can contain:

| File          | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `theme.css`   | Color/visual tokens (`--accent`, `--bg`, `--good`, …). Loaded **after** the base `dashboard.css`, so any selector here overrides it.                                                                                                                                             |
| `theme.js`    | Optional JS hook. Loaded after `dashboard.js` with `defer onerror="this.remove()"` — if the file is missing the tag quietly self-removes.                                                                                                                                        |
| `index.html`  | Optional full template override for the desktop dashboard. When present, replaces the base `dashboard.html` entirely; the theme then owns the whole page and only talks to the backend via `/api/state`, `/api/chart`, `/health`.                                                |

| `assets/…`    | Theme-owned images / fonts / extra CSS / JS, served at `/themes/<your_name>/assets/<path>`. Extensions are whitelisted (`png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `webp`, `gif`, `svg`, `ico`, `woff`, `woff2`, `ttf`, `otf`, `css`, `js`, `json`, `map`, `mp3`, `wav`) — anything else returns 415. |

Template substitutions applied to both the base and any per-theme `index.html` / `mobile.html`:
`__REFRESH_MS__`, `__IMAGES__` (JSON), `__BRAND_BADGE__` (data URI), `__THEME__` (the active theme folder name).

Theme folder names must match `^[a-z0-9_-]{1,40}$`. Copy `themes/example_custom/` as a starting point — it has a minimal `index.html`, `theme.css`, and `theme.js` showing the substitutions and a `fetch('/api/state')` poll loop.
- `https`: serve the dashboard over HTTPS instead of HTTP. Requires `ssl_certfile`.
- `ssl_certfile`: path to the PEM-encoded SSL certificate file.
- `ssl_keyfile`: path to the PEM-encoded SSL private key file. If the key is included in the certfile, this can be left empty.
- `charting`: nested chart settings with two layers:
  - `compact`: settings for the embedded chart

How charting options behave:

- `max_bars`: how many bars to draw. Compact and expanded profiles clamp to sane limits.
- `show_volume`: show or hide the volume panel.
- `show_moving_averages`, `show_vwap`: core price overlays.
- `show_support_resistance`, `show_next_support_resistance`, `show_full_support_resistance_ladder`: how much of the support/resistance map to draw.
- `show_key_level_zones`, `show_key_level_zone_labels`: peer-confirmed zone overlays.
- `show_bollinger_bands`, `show_anchored_vwap`, `show_fib_extensions`, `show_channel`, `show_trendlines`: heavier technical overlays.
- `show_htf_fair_value_gaps`, `show_ltf_fair_value_gaps`: HTF and LTF FVG overlays. Cross-timeframe protection is enforced automatically, so HTF FVGs do not render on the LTF chart and LTF FVGs do not render on the HTF chart.
- `show_htf_order_blocks`, `show_ltf_order_blocks`: HTF and LTF order block overlays. Render with a dashed-line border around a very faint fill so they are visually distinct from the solid-filled FVG overlays. Same green/red bullish/bearish color semantics. Driven by `support_resistance.htf_order_blocks_enabled` / `ltf_order_blocks_enabled` and the shared OB tuning knobs (`order_block_mode`, etc.). Cross-timeframe protection is enforced the same way as for FVGs.
- `show_trade_markers`: entry/exit markers on the chart.
- `tooltip_show_*`: toggle tooltip sections individually.
- In `compact` and `expanded`, using `null` means “inherit from `shared`.”

### `support_resistance`

Higher-timeframe support/resistance, prior-day/week levels, FVG mapping, flip handling, and market-structure context.

How the groups work:

- Core HTF level map:
  - `enabled`, `timeframe_minutes`, `lookback_days`, `pivot_span`, `max_levels_per_side`
  - Use these to decide how the level map is built. HTF refresh cadence is bar-aligned (one Schwab call per HTF bar boundary, plus a 10-second settle buffer) — there's no longer a refresh-seconds knob.
- Level width and proximity:
  - `atr_tolerance_mult`, `pct_tolerance`, `same_side_min_gap_atr_mult`, `same_side_min_gap_pct`, `fallback_reference_max_drift_atr_mult`, `fallback_reference_max_drift_pct`, `proximity_atr_mult`, `breakout_atr_mult`, `breakout_buffer_pct`, `stop_buffer_atr_mult`
  - Larger values make levels and breakout/stop buffers looser; smaller values make them tighter.
  - `same_side_min_gap_*` adds an extra upstream minimum-separation pass so near-duplicate same-side ladder levels collapse before they reach the engine payloads and dashboard. This now applies consistently to both the support/resistance builder and the HTF level map.
  - `fallback_reference_max_drift_*` guards prior day/week fallback side classification against stale or detached live prices by snapping that fallback-only reference back to the latest bar close when the drift is too large.
- Entry clearance and scoring:
  - `entry_min_clearance_atr`, `entry_min_clearance_pct`, `entry_proximity_scoring_enabled`, `entry_bias_score_weight`, `entry_favorable_proximity_bonus`, `entry_opposing_proximity_penalty`
  - These decide how strongly nearby HTF levels help or hurt an entry.
- Static reference levels:
  - `use_prior_day_high_low`, `use_prior_week_high_low`
  - Allow prior-day / prior-week highs and lows as fallback levels only when a side ends up empty after normal S/R detection and cleanup. Those fallback levels are admitted on the correct side of the guarded fallback reference price, can still participate in normal flip handling, and flow through the normal S/R ladder logic. If no prior-day/week fallback is eligible, the builders can fall back to the frame extreme for that side.
- FVG detection:
  - `htf_fair_value_gaps_enabled` toggles HTF FVG generation; `ltf_fair_value_gaps_enabled` toggles LTF FVG generation. The shared `fair_value_gap_max_per_side`, `fair_value_gap_min_atr_mult`, and `fair_value_gap_min_pct` knobs apply to both timeframes.
  - Raising the min ATR or min percent thresholds makes FVG detection more selective.
- Order block detection:
  - `htf_order_blocks_enabled` and `ltf_order_blocks_enabled` toggle OB generation per timeframe.
  - `order_block_mode`: `loose` declares a break-of-structure when price prints a new N-bar high (`order_block_new_high_lookback`); `strict` requires a pivot-confirmed BoS (`order_block_pivot_span`). Strict produces fewer, higher-quality OBs.
  - `order_block_min_atr_mult` and `order_block_min_pct` set the minimum OB body size (whichever is larger).
  - `order_block_min_thrust_atr_mult` (default `0.75`) requires the BoS thrust — close-to-close move from the OB candle to the breakout candle — to be at least this fraction of ATR. Filters weak setups where a small candle randomly broke a recent high.
  - `order_block_max_per_side` caps OBs per side per timeframe. Ranking is strength-based (thrust × size × age × validity), so the strongest OBs survive when the cap clips — small-move noise OBs no longer displace strong OBs from real moves.
- Level-loss and flip behavior:
  - `trading_flip_confirmation_1m_bars` and `trading_flip_confirmation_5m_bars` tune how many bars confirm a level flip via the dual-frame OR rule (either gate fires confirms). The dashboard sidebar, dashboard chart zone classification, entry gatekeeper, position manager, and strategy entries all use this same strict gate so every consumer agrees on which side of a level price is sitting on.
  - Whether confirmed level-loss breaks trigger an exit is controlled by `shared_exit.use_sr_loss_exit`.
  - `flip_stop_buffer_atr_mult` controls how far beyond a flipped level the stop is anchored when `risk.trade_management_mode: sr_flip` is active.
  - `flip_target_requires_momentum_confirm` prevents target extension on weak flips.
- Regime and structure:
  - `regime_weight` controls how strongly the S/R regime influences scoring.
  - `structure_enabled`, `structure_ltf_pivot_span`, `structure_eq_atr_mult`, `structure_ltf_weight`, `structure_htf_weight`, `structure_event_lookback_bars` control the mixed-timeframe structure layer. The CHoCH-exit toggle is `shared_exit.use_structure_exit`.
  - `structure_min_range_atr_mult` (default `1.5`) — when both EQH and EQL flags are set AND the spread between `reference_high` and `reference_low` is below this ATR threshold, the structure-derived `bias` resolves to `"neutral"` instead of firing midpoint / pivot / recent-event bias. Prevents bias-based structure exits (`structure_bearish_exit` / `structure_bullish_exit`) from firing inside a tight consolidation where bias would flip on noise. Genuine BoS through `reference_high` / `reference_low` (price actually broke out) still fires bias unchanged — that check runs BEFORE the tight-range short-circuit. `eqh` / `eql` flags remain set so range-regime entries (which key on the EQ labels for mean-reversion setups) still see them. CHoCH exits unaffected. Set `0.0` to disable.
  - `structure_min_pivot_gap_bars` (default `0`) — minimum bar separation between consecutive *alternating* structure pivots. When `> 0`, an opposite-kind pivot that prints closer than this many bars to the prior kept pivot is treated as intra-leg noise and skipped, so the leg continues instead of registering a 1-2-bar swing. Suppresses the HH/LH/EQH/LL/HL/EQL churn (and the BOS/CHoCH/structure-exit signals keyed on those labels) that volatile names produce on a fine frame. The swings are still ATR-sized, so this is purely a temporal-density filter, not an amplitude one. `0` disables it (original behavior for every strategy that doesn't set it).
  - `structure_ltf_timeframe_minutes` (default `0`) — resample the `"ltf"` structure frame to this many minutes before pivot analysis. The LTF structure context otherwise runs on the raw streaming frame (1m), which is finer than the regime-scoring LTF (`params.ltf_minutes`, often 5m) — making structure pivots ~5x denser than the bars the strategy actually trades on. When `> 0`, entry/exit/HTF-alignment all read structure off the coarser frame. `0` disables it (use the frame as-is). NOTE: raising this rescales every bar-based structure setting — `structure_event_lookback_bars` and `structure_exit_min_post_entry_pivots` are then in units of this timeframe, so lower them proportionally when enabling (e.g. `structure_event_lookback_bars` 6 → 3 for a 1m→5m switch).
- Structure-exit grace windows:
  - `structure_exit_grace_minutes` (default `10`) suppresses `structure_bearish_exit` / `structure_bullish_exit` for the first N minutes after entry. Prevents a minor EQL/LL pivot forming in the first few minutes from exiting an otherwise-healthy trade. CHoCH exits still fire.
  - `structure_exit_min_post_entry_pivots` (default `2`) requires at least N new LTF-structure pivots to form AFTER entry before structure-based bias exits can fire. Complements the time grace. (The LTF structure frame is 1m by default but follows `structure_ltf_timeframe_minutes` — so under a 5m structure these are 5m pivots and take proportionally longer to accumulate; lower this knob if the coarser frame holds losers too long.)
  - `structure_exit_grace_minutes_pullback` (default `15`) extends the grace specifically for the pullback regime (`position.metadata.regime == "pullback"`). Pullback by design enters into LTF chop, so the first EQL/LL pivot is almost always noise. Falls back to the global grace when set lower. Added 2026-05-14 after AMD 14:36 LONG pullback was killed at hold=10.2m via `structure_bearish_exit:EQL` then recovered above target.
  - `structure_exit_require_bos_confirmation` (default `true`) additionally requires an active BoS event (`bos_down` for long-exit, `bos_up` for short-exit) — not just a bias flip — before bias-based structure exits fire. EQL/HH alone is noisy; BoS means price actually broke a prior swing low/high. CHoCH exits are unaffected. Set to `false` to revert to bias-only behavior.
  - `orb_entry_exit_grace_minutes` (default `20`) extends the grace specifically for positions entered during the ORB window (09:35 to `orb_end_time`). Suppresses BOTH `structure_bearish/bullish_exit` AND `chart_pattern_exit` for the first N minutes of ORB-entered trades. ORB pullbacks frequently look like bearish structure breaks but continue higher once the opening flush resolves. Set to `0` to disable. CHoCH exits still fire.

How the groups work:

- Global enable:
  - `enabled` turns the whole block on or off.
- Fib extensions:
  - `fib_*` controls extension detection and how close price must be before fib levels matter.
- Channels:
  - `channel_*` controls pivot channel detection, tolerance, and how near price must be to a channel edge.
- Trend lines:
  - `trendline_*` controls pivot trendline detection and breakout sensitivity.
- ADX / trend quality:
  - `adx_*` adds bonus/penalty based on trend strength and whether ADX is rising.
- Anchored VWAP:
  - `anchored_vwap_*` rewards entries aligned with anchored VWAP and can also contribute to exits.
  - `anchored_vwap_impulse_lookback_bars`, `anchored_vwap_min_impulse_atr`, and `anchored_vwap_pivot_span` optionally decouple impulse-anchor selection from Fib settings while preserving old behavior when left `null`.
- ATR context:
  - `atr_context_*`, `atr_expansion_*`, and `atr_stretch_*` reward healthy expansion and penalize stretched entries.
- OBV / participation:
  - `obv_*` rewards or penalizes order-flow participation.
- Divergence:
  - `divergence_*` controls RSI/OBV divergence detection and the score adjustments derived from it. Detection is multi-pivot (walks the most recent `divergence_pivot_lookback` swing pivots) and age-gated (matches whose newest pivot is more than `divergence_max_age_bars` from the latest bar are dropped). `divergence_min_price_move_pct` is the price-move floor a pivot pair must clear before a divergence can register.
  - **Two pattern families.** *Regular* divergence (price extends, indicator weakens) signals a likely reversal. *Hidden* divergence (price holds the trend, indicator pulls back) signals continuation. Counter-direction regular divergence on an entry triggers `divergence_counter_*_penalty`; same-direction hidden divergence on an entry triggers `divergence_hidden_bonus_*`.
  - **Two timeframes.** RSI divergence is computed on both the strategy's primary frame (LTF) and the HTF context. HTF-aligned divergence in the trade direction adds `htf_divergence_aligned_bonus_rsi`; HTF counter-direction divergence subtracts `htf_divergence_counter_penalty_rsi`; HTF same-direction hidden divergence adds `htf_divergence_hidden_bonus_rsi`. The `_rsi` suffix on these HTF knobs is deliberate — HTF OBV divergence is intentionally not computed (volume-driven indicators smear under HTF resampling).
  - **Visual rendering.** Each detected divergence is drawn on the price chart as a trendline connecting the two pivots, color-coded green (bullish) or red (bearish), solid stroke for regular and dashed stroke for hidden. RSI divergences render at full intensity, OBV at lighter weight. Toggle per chart profile via `dashboard.charting.{compact,expanded}.show_rsi_divergence` (default true) and `show_obv_divergence` (default false).
- Bollinger context:
  - `bollinger_*` controls band calculation, squeeze detection, entry confluence, optional targeting, and optional exits.
- Target/stop refinement:
  - `target_use_bollinger`, `target_use_fib`, `target_use_channel`, `target_use_trendline`, `stop_use_trendline`
- Entry bonuses/penalties:
  - `entry_bonus_channel_alignment`, `entry_bonus_trendline_respect`, `entry_penalty_near_extension`
- Exit toggles live in `shared_exit.use_trendline_break`, `use_channel_break`, `use_bollinger_reject`, `use_anchored_vwap_loss` (detectors still owned here; when to fire is decided there).

### `shared_entry`

Global entry-side helper toggles. These replace the old per-strategy logic-override system.

| Option                                       | Code default |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------|
| `use_fvg_context`                            | `true`       |
| `use_divergence_filter`                      | `true`       |
| `use_htf_divergence_filter`                  | `true`       |
| `use_divergence_entry_signal`                | `false`      |
| `divergence_entry_min_age_bars`              | `0`          |
| `divergence_entry_require_sr_confluence`     | `true`       |
| `divergence_entry_score_floor`               | `1.5`        |
| `divergence_entry_score_bump`                | `0.20`       |
| `use_technical_entry_adjustment`             | `true`       |
| `use_technical_stop_target_refinement`       | `true`       |
| `use_structure_filter`                       | `true`       |
| `use_sr_filter`                              | `true`       |
| `use_sr_stop_target_refinement`              | `true`       |
| `use_opposing_chart_filter`                  | `true`       |
| `use_opposing_candle_filter`                 | `false`      |
| `min_target_rr`                              | `1.0`        |

Behavior:

- All boolean fields default to `true`. `true` enables that shared entry helper globally; `false` disables it globally.
- `use_fvg_context`: allow FVG context to adjust entry scoring.
- `use_divergence_filter`: allow LTF RSI/OBV regular divergence to penalize entries against the trade direction. Hidden divergence in trade direction is bonused via `technical_levels.divergence_hidden_bonus_*`.
- `use_htf_divergence_filter`: allow HTF RSI divergence (computed in `htf_levels.build_htf_context`) to score entries via `technical_levels.htf_divergence_*` bonuses/penalties. Independent gate from the LTF divergence filter — set false to disable HTF-side divergence influence while keeping the LTF filter active.
- `use_divergence_entry_signal` (off by default): enable the shared opt-in entry helper `_divergence_entry_candidate(side, ...)` in `BaseStrategy`. Strategies that opt in invoke this helper to surface a divergence-driven entry candidate (with stop, target, score, and S/R confluence check). Returns `None` unless: the divergence age is in `[divergence_entry_min_age_bars, technical_levels.divergence_max_age_bars]`, the pivot is within `sr_ctx.level_buffer` of an aligned S/R level (when `divergence_entry_require_sr_confluence` is true), and the computed score clears `divergence_entry_score_floor`. Score blends indicator delta, recency, kind (regular vs hidden), and S/R confluence bonus. The strategy's primary signal still wins on conflicts; if both fire same direction the score gets a `divergence_entry_score_bump`.
- `use_technical_entry_adjustment`: let `technical_levels` adjust entry quality scoring.
- `use_technical_stop_target_refinement`: allow `technical_levels` to refine stops/targets.
- `use_structure_filter`: allow the mixed-timeframe structure layer to help or hurt entries.
- `use_sr_filter`: allow HTF support/resistance clearance and regime context to affect entries.
- `use_sr_stop_target_refinement`: allow support/resistance to refine initial stops/targets.
- `use_opposing_chart_filter`: block entries when opposing chart patterns are present.
- `use_opposing_candle_filter`: block entries when opposing-direction candle patterns cluster above `candles.opposing_net_score_threshold` (default 0.70 = "solid" tier). Reuses the cached candle context — no extra ta-lib calls.
- `min_target_rr` (float, default `1.0`): risk-to-reward floor enforced by **all four** target-refinement passes (`_refine_bullish_sr_levels`, `_refine_bearish_sr_levels`, `_refine_bullish_technical_levels`, `_refine_bearish_technical_levels`). When a refine pass would cap the target so close to entry that R:R drops below this threshold, the cap is rejected and the strategy's original target is kept. Protects against the "$0.10 target" failure mode where nearby S/R or technical levels collapse R:R toward zero. The check is independent of `risk.trade_management_mode` — it applies whether you run `adaptive`, `adaptive_ladder`, `none`, `sr_flip`, or any other mode. Set higher (e.g. `1.5` or `2.0`) for stricter quality, lower (or `0`) to disable.

### `shared_exit`

Global exit-side helper toggles and tape-confirmation thresholds.

| Option                             | Code default |
|------------------------------------|--------------|
| `use_technical_exit`               | `true`       |
| `use_trendline_break`              | `true`       |
| `use_channel_break`                | `true`       |
| `use_bollinger_reject`             | `false`      |
| `use_anchored_vwap_loss`           | `true`       |
| `use_chart_pattern_exit`           | `false`      |
| `use_candle_pattern_exit`          | `false`      |
| `use_structure_exit`               | `true`       |
| `use_sr_loss_exit`                 | `true`       |
| `use_divergence_exit_signal`       | `false`      |
| `divergence_exit_partial_frac`     | `0.5`        |
| `divergence_exit_min_age_bars`     | `1`          |
| `divergence_exit_require_in_profit`| `true`       |
| `confirm_with_ema9`                | `true`       |
| `confirm_with_ema20`               | `true`       |
| `confirm_with_vwap`                | `true`       |
| `confirm_with_close_position`      | `true`       |
| `bullish_close_position_max`       | `0.46`       |
| `bearish_close_position_min`       | `0.54`       |
| `bullish_close_position_loose_max` | `0.38`       |
| `bearish_close_position_loose_min` | `0.62`       |

Behavior:

- The `use_*` fields are booleans.
- `use_technical_exit`: master enable for technical exits.
- `use_trendline_break`, `use_channel_break`, `use_bollinger_reject`, `use_anchored_vwap_loss`: finer control over which technical exits are allowed.
- `use_chart_pattern_exit`: allow opposing chart patterns to help trigger exits.
- `use_candle_pattern_exit`: fire `candle_pattern_exit:<pattern>` when an opposing-direction candle cluster crosses `candles.opposing_net_score_threshold` and the tape confirms (via `confirm_with_*` thresholds below). Reuses cached candle context.
- `use_structure_exit`: allow CHOCH / structure-loss exits.
- `use_sr_loss_exit`: allow exits on confirmed loss of important support/resistance.
- `use_divergence_exit_signal` (off by default): enable the shared opt-in exit helper `_divergence_exit_signal(side, in_profit, tech_ctx)` in `BaseStrategy`. When a counter-direction REGULAR divergence forms on a held position and its age is in `[divergence_exit_min_age_bars, technical_levels.divergence_max_age_bars]`, the helper returns `(reason, partial_frac)` and the strategy can act on it. Hidden divergence (continuation) is never an exit trigger. `divergence_exit_partial_frac` controls partial close size (0.0-1.0; 0.5 closes half, leaving the other half on a trailing stop). `divergence_exit_require_in_profit` (default true) gates the exit so a losing position isn't scratched on noise.
- `confirm_with_ema9`, `confirm_with_ema20`, `confirm_with_vwap`, `confirm_with_close_position`: tape-confirmation requirements applied before shared exits are accepted.
- `bullish_close_position_max` / `bearish_close_position_min`: strict candle close-location thresholds used when confirming bearish exits from long trades or bullish exits from short trades.
- `bullish_close_position_loose_max` / `bearish_close_position_loose_min`: looser fallback thresholds for the same confirmation family.

### `options`

Shared 0DTE ETF option-engine settings. Both option strategies use this block.

  - `styles`: valid values are `orb_debit_spread`, `trend_debit_spread`, `midday_credit_spread`, `orb_long_option`, `trend_long_option`. The spread strategy uses the spread styles; the long-option strategy uses only `orb_long_option` and `trend_long_option` for its two directional style gates.
- Basic chain quality filters:
  - `min_underlying_price`, `min_option_volume`, `min_open_interest` filter the option universe.
  - `max_bid_ask_spread_pct`, `max_leg_spread_dollars`, `max_net_spread_pct`, `max_net_spread_price`, `min_net_mid_price` filter quote quality.
- Target deltas / structure:
  - `target_long_delta`, `target_short_delta` are used for vertical spreads.
  - `target_single_delta` is used for long-premium single legs.
  - `strike_width_by_symbol` optionally overrides vertical width by symbol.
- Position sizing and loss limits:
  - `max_contracts_per_trade`, `max_loss_per_trade`
- Exit math:
  - `debit_stop_frac`, `debit_target_mult`, `credit_stop_mult`, `credit_target_frac`, `single_stop_frac`, `single_target_mult`
- Entry pricing:
  - `option_limit_mode` and `vertical_limit_mode` valid values are `mid`, `natural`, `bid`.
    - `mid`: price off mid when possible.
    - `natural`: pay/receive the natural side first, then fall back.
    - `bid`: price more defensively.
- Time controls:
  - `force_flatten_time`: 24-hour `HH:MM` time string used by option strategies to flatten before the close.
- Volatility guards:
  - `max_vix`: hard cap — block ALL option entries when VIX is above this level. Long premium gets too expensive (vega risk); credit spreads also less attractive vs the downside risk.
  - `min_vix` (default `0.0` = disabled): hard floor — block entries when VIX is below this level. Long-premium strategies suffer in dead-grind tape where the typical daily range can't overcome theta + commissions. Set to `~12.0` for long-call/long-put strategies; leave at `0.0` for credit-spread strategies (which benefit from low VIX).
  - `vix_spike_pct`: block when VIX is moving fast (mid-session repricing risk).
  - **IV-rank gate** (`vix_52w_low` / `vix_52w_high` / `min_iv_rank` / `max_iv_rank`): computes `iv_rank = (vix_last − vix_52w_low) / (vix_52w_high − vix_52w_low)` clamped to `[0,1]` and blocks entries outside `[min_iv_rank, max_iv_rank]`. Normalizes against the rolling 52-week range rather than absolute VIX level — VIX 20 might be "high" in a 12-18 regime but "low" in a 25-35 regime. Long-premium strategies should cap `max_iv_rank: 0.75` (don't buy when in top 25% — IV expensive); credit-spread strategies should floor `min_iv_rank: 0.30` (don't sell when in bottom 30% — credits skinny). The `vix_52w_low` / `vix_52w_high` values are user-supplied (refresh quarterly) — no live fetching, deterministic, no extra API calls.
- Quote-stability checks:
  - `quote_stability_checks`, `quote_stability_pause_ms`, `max_mid_drift_pct`, `max_quote_age_seconds`
  - These make the bot re-check quotes before finalizing a trade.
- Dry-run replace controls:
  - `dry_run_replace_attempts`, `dry_run_step_frac`
- Macro-event blackout controls:
  - `event_blackout_file`: YAML file with recurring or dated blackout windows.
  - `event_blackouts`: inline list of blackout rows. File rows and inline rows are both loaded.
  - Each blackout row can use: `enabled`, `label`, `date`, `weekday`, `start`, `end`, `block_new_entries`, `force_flatten`.
- Chain cache:
  - `option_chain_cache_seconds`, `option_chain_cache_max_entries`
  - 0DTE strategies (`zero_dte_etf_options`, `zero_dte_etf_long_options`) parallel-prefetch chains for all qualifying candidates at the start of each `entry_signals` pass; the sequential per-candidate build loop then hits the warm cache. Size `option_chain_cache_max_entries` ≥ the number of underlyings you trade so prefetched chains aren't evicted before consumption.
- Premium ratchet (post-entry stop management). All four premium-ratchet families are off by default; enable the ones you want active.
  - `options_breakeven_enabled` / `options_breakeven_mark_mult` / `options_breakeven_stop_mult`: when the option mark crosses `entry × options_breakeven_mark_mult`, ratchet the stop up to `entry × options_breakeven_stop_mult`. Locks a small protective gain on debit trades that go through their first push.
  - `options_profit_lock_enabled` / `options_profit_lock_mark_mult` / `options_profit_lock_stop_mult`: a second, looser ratchet that activates at a higher mark multiple and locks a larger fraction of the move. Stacks with `options_breakeven_*`.
- Time-decay-aware stop/target scaling for debit trades:
  - `debit_target_time_decay_enabled`: master toggle. When `true`, the debit target shrinks linearly between `debit_target_time_decay_start` and `debit_target_time_decay_end` (HH:MM in `runtime.timezone`), and the debit stop widens proportionally so theta-decayed trades aren't stopped on noise.
  - `debit_target_time_decay_start` / `debit_target_time_decay_end`: scaling window. Outside this window, the standard `debit_target_mult` and `debit_stop_frac` apply unchanged.
  - `debit_target_time_decay_min_scale`: lower bound on the target scale at the end of the window (e.g. `0.70` = target collapses to 70% of `debit_target_mult` by `debit_target_time_decay_end`).
  - `debit_stop_time_decay_widen_factor`: how much the stop widens at the end of the window relative to the target shrink (e.g. `0.30` = stop loosens by 30% × the target shrink).
- Time-aware delta selection (long-leg side of debit verticals and singles):
  - `delta_time_shift_enabled`: master toggle. When `true`, after `delta_time_shift_start` the bot adds `delta_time_shift_per_hour × hours_elapsed` to `target_long_delta` / `target_single_delta`, capped at `delta_time_shift_max`. Picks deeper-ITM strikes later in the day to fight theta.
  - `delta_time_shift_per_hour`: shift-per-hour added to the target delta after `delta_time_shift_start`.
  - `delta_time_shift_max`: hard cap on cumulative delta shift.
  - `delta_time_shift_start`: HH:MM at which the shift begins accumulating.
- Trend entry momentum filter (applies to `trend_*` styles):
  - `trend_momentum_filter_enabled`: when `true`, requires both ATR expansion and volume confirmation before a trend entry fires.
  - `trend_min_atr_expansion`: minimum recent-ATR / baseline-ATR ratio required.
  - `trend_min_volume_ratio`: minimum recent-volume / baseline-volume ratio required.
- Credit strike distance gate (applies to `midday_credit_spread`):
  - `credit_distance_gate_enabled`: when `true`, requires the short strike to sit at least `min_credit_distance_atr × ATR` from the current underlying price before a credit spread is allowed.
  - `min_credit_distance_atr`: ATR multiple defining the minimum strike-to-spot distance.
- Credit pivot-buffer gate (applies to `midday_credit_spread`; added 2026-05-21):
  - `credit_pivot_buffer_gate_enabled`: when `true`, requires the short strike to sit at least `min_short_strike_pivot_buffer_atr × ATR` beyond the recent market-structure pivot (LTF/HTF `reference_high` for bear call; `reference_low` for bull put). Catches the "short sitting ON the pivot" failure mode the distance gate above misses — the distance gate measures from current spot, which can pass even when the short is at a recent high.
  - `min_short_strike_pivot_buffer_atr`: ATR multiple defining the minimum cushion from the pivot.
- VIX-adaptive strike width:
  - `adaptive_width_enabled`: when `true`, scales `strike_width_by_symbol` up by a VIX-driven factor capped at `adaptive_width_max_scale`. Wider verticals when VIX is elevated, baseline width when VIX is normal.
  - `adaptive_width_max_scale`: hard upper bound on the per-symbol width multiplier.

## `strategies.<name>` block reference

The standard example/main config does not need a top-level `strategies:` section, but shipped portable presets include one so each preset fully describes the selected strategy. The selected top-level config file is the runtime authority for its own `strategies.<name>` block.

The block uses this outer structure:

- `entry_windows`: list of `[start, end]` windows when the strategy may open new positions.
- `management_windows`: list of `[start, end]` windows used for flat-time background work and default force-flatten timing.
- `screener_windows`: list of `[start, end]` windows when the screener may refresh.
- `params`: strategy-specific tuning dictionary that overrides the manifest defaults for that strategy only.

For TradingView screener percentage fields used by stock strategies, this bot expects **whole percent units** in YAML.

Examples:

- `4.0` means `4%`
- `16.0` means `16%`
- for sub-1% thresholds, use a quoted string like `"0.5%"`

Legacy decimal values such as `0.04` are still accepted and normalized to `4.0` with a warning.

## Shared stock-strategy parameter groups

These groups are reused across several stock strategies.

### Force-flatten

- `force_flatten.long`
- `force_flatten.short`
- Valid values: `true` or `false` for each side
- When a side is `true`, the bot auto-flattens open stock positions on that side at the end of the final `management_windows` block for that strategy.
- When a side is `false`, that side may hold overnight.

### Anti-chase / exhaustion filter

Used by the continuation-style stock strategies.

- `entry_exhaustion_filter_enabled`
- `max_entry_vwap_extension_atr`
- `max_entry_ema9_extension_atr`
- `max_entry_bar_range_atr`
- `max_entry_upper_wick_frac`
- `max_entry_lower_wick_frac`
- `entry_wick_close_position_guard`

Behavior:

- These fields decide whether the last trigger bar is too extended or too rejective to enter immediately.
- Smaller extension or wick thresholds make the bot more conservative.
- Larger thresholds allow more aggressive continuation entries.

### Anti-chase FVG retest defer logic

Used by the continuation-style stock strategies.

- `anti_chase_fvg_retest_enabled`
- `anti_chase_fvg_retest_lookback_bars`
- `anti_chase_fvg_retest_max_gap_distance_pct`
- `anti_chase_fvg_retest_max_opposing_distance_pct`
- `anti_chase_fvg_retest_min_close_position`
- `anti_chase_fvg_retest_stop_buffer_gap_frac`

Behavior:

- When enabled, an overextended continuation entry can shift from **enter now** to **wait for a same-direction LTF FVG retest**.
- Larger distance thresholds make the bot accept looser FVG retests.
- Higher `anti_chase_fvg_retest_min_close_position` requires a stronger reclaim candle on the retest.
- `anti_chase_fvg_retest_stop_buffer_gap_frac` controls how tight the stop anchors around the defended FVG.

### Stock FVG confluence

Used by all stock strategies.

- `htf_fvg_entry_weight`
- `ltf_fvg_entry_weight`
- `opposing_fvg_entry_penalty_mult`
- `fvg_runner_rr_bonus`

Behavior:

- Higher `htf_fvg_entry_weight` or `ltf_fvg_entry_weight` makes same-direction FVG context matter more.
- Higher `opposing_fvg_entry_penalty_mult` makes nearby opposing FVGs more punitive.
- `fvg_runner_rr_bonus` adds extra room to stronger trades when FVG continuation context is favorable.

### Adaptive stock trade management

Used when `risk.trade_management_mode: adaptive` or `risk.trade_management_mode: adaptive_ladder`.

- `adaptive_breakeven_rr`
- `adaptive_profit_lock_rr`
- `adaptive_profit_lock_stop_rr`
- `adaptive_runner_trigger_rr`

Behavior:

- `adaptive_breakeven_rr`: progress threshold that can move the stop to breakeven.
- `adaptive_profit_lock_rr`: progress threshold that can lock some profit.
- `adaptive_profit_lock_stop_rr`: how much profit is locked once the previous threshold is met.
- `adaptive_runner_trigger_rr`: progress threshold that can activate runner behavior.
- Lower thresholds protect faster; higher thresholds give trades more room.

## Strategy-by-strategy reference

### `momentum_close`

Purpose: late-day continuation in strong small-cap movers.

Default windows:

- `entry_windows`: `[['13:45', '15:39']]`
- `management_windows`: `[['13:30', '15:54']]`
- `screener_windows`: `[['10:30', '11:20'], ['13:30', '15:25']]`

Strategy-specific knobs:

- `min_rvol`: minimum relative volume.
- `breakout_lookback_bars`: lookback used to define the breakout trigger.

Also uses these shared stock groups:

### `rth_trend_pullback`

Purpose: full-session continuation strategy that looks for pullbacks holding support/resistance and then re-expanding.

Default windows:

- `entry_windows`: `[['09:38', '15:45']]`
- `management_windows`: `[['09:33', '15:58']]`
- `screener_windows`: `[['09:33', '15:45']]`

Strategy-specific knobs:

- `min_change_from_open` / `max_change_from_open`: whole-percent session-strength bounds using the canonical active-session move field.
- `min_rvol`: minimum relative volume.
- `min_bars`: bars required before evaluation.
- `support_lookback_bars`: recent bars used to define the pullback support/resistance zone.
- `trigger_lookback_bars`: bars used to define the local re-expansion trigger.
- `support_hold_pct`: tolerance used to decide whether the pullback held support or stayed capped by resistance.
- `max_extension_from_vwap_pct`: absolute VWAP-extension cap before entry.
- `min_bar_close_position`: minimum close-location quality for the trigger candle.
- `trend_min_ret5` / `trend_min_ret15`: short-horizon trend-strength thresholds.
- `target_rr`: initial reward-to-risk target before further refinement.
- `strong_trend_runner_enabled`: allow the strongest trend setups to aim farther.
- `strong_trend_target_rr`: target RR used for those strong-runner cases.

Also uses these shared stock groups:

- force-flatten
- anti-chase / exhaustion
- anti-chase FVG retest defer logic
- stock FVG confluence
- adaptive stock trade management

### `volatility_squeeze_breakout`

Purpose: trade liquid-stock volatility compression that resolves with a directional breakout and expansion.

Default windows:

- `entry_windows`: `[['09:48', '15:38']]`
- `management_windows`: `[['09:33', '15:58']]`
- `screener_windows`: `[['09:33', '15:38']]`

Strategy-specific knobs:

- `min_change_from_open` / `max_change_from_open`: whole-percent session-strength bounds used by the screener's canonical active-session move field.
- `min_rvol`: minimum relative volume.
- `min_bars`: bars required before evaluation.
- `squeeze_lookback_bars`: bars used to define the compression box.
- `squeeze_baseline_bars`: bars used to measure whether current volatility is compressed relative to recent history.
- `max_squeeze_range_pct`: maximum allowed box height as a percentage of price.
- `max_squeeze_range_atr`: maximum allowed box height in ATR units.
- `max_squeeze_width_pct`: maximum median Bollinger width percentage allowed inside the squeeze.
- `max_squeeze_width_ratio`: maximum squeeze-width ratio versus the baseline window.
- `breakout_buffer_pct`: extra breakout buffer above / below the squeeze box.
- `min_bar_close_position`: minimum close-location quality required on the trigger bar.
- `min_breakout_volume_ratio`: minimum current-bar volume ratio versus median squeeze-box volume.
- `min_atr_expansion_mult`: minimum ATR-expansion confirmation.
- `min_pressure_drift_pct`: minimum drift required in rising lows / falling highs inside the box.
- `require_vwap_alignment`: require price to break in the same direction as VWAP bias.
- `require_avwap_alignment`: require price to agree with anchored VWAP impulse context when available.
- `prefer_bollinger_squeeze_flag`: when enabled, prefer the built-in Bollinger squeeze flag to agree with the custom compression checks.
- `target_rr`: initial reward-to-risk target before refinements.
- `runner_enabled`: allow the strongest squeeze breakouts to use the farther target logic.
- `runner_target_rr`: target RR used for those runner cases.

Also uses these shared stock groups:

- force-flatten
- anti-chase / exhaustion
- anti-chase FVG retest defer logic

### `peer_confirmed_trend_continuation`

A peer-confirmed continuation strategy that reuses the peer/macro confirmation model from `peer_confirmed_key_levels`, but replaces key-level touch entries with trend-aligned pullback and re-expansion triggers. It prefers symbols already trending with peers aligned, then enters on a controlled pullback that holds continuation structure and resolves back in the trend direction.

Purpose: join an existing intraday trend after a controlled pullback and a fresh continuation trigger, while peers and optional macro symbols still agree with the move.

Default windows:

- `entry_windows`: `[['07:10', '11:50'], ['12:55', '15:40']]`
- `management_windows`: `[['07:00', '15:58']]`
- `screener_windows`: `[['07:00', '15:40']]`

### `peer_confirmed_key_levels`

Purpose: trade around HTF key levels/zones only when a tradable symbol, its peer basket, and optional macro symbols agree strongly enough, then ride the cleaned S/R ladder while price action still defends the last reclaimed/broken rung.

Default windows:

- `entry_windows`: `[['07:10', '15:35']]`
- `management_windows`: `[['07:00', '15:58']]`
- `screener_windows`: `[['07:00', '15:35']]`

Strategy-specific knobs:

- Universe and HTF map:
  - `tradable`, `peers`
  - `htf_minutes`, `htf_lookback_days`, `htf_pivot_span`, `htf_max_levels_per_side`, `htf_atr_tolerance_mult`, `htf_pct_tolerance`, `htf_stop_buffer_atr_mult`, `htf_ema_fast_span`, `htf_ema_slow_span`
- Trigger frame and warmup:
  - `ltf_minutes`, `min_bars`, `min_ltf_bars`
  - Stronger signals are prioritized lexicographically by trigger quality, level quality, peer confirmation, vote edge, and clearance before smaller additive bonuses are allowed to break ties.
- Zone, score, and R:R:
  - `zone_atr_mult`, `zone_pct`, `min_level_score`, `min_ltf_score`, `min_rr`, `stop_buffer_atr_mult`
  - `ltf_quality_bonus_enabled`, `ltf_quality_max_bonus`, `ltf_reclaim_quality_bonus_cap`, `ltf_zone_interaction_bonus_cap`, `ltf_candle_quality_bonus_cap`, `ltf_volume_quality_bonus_cap`, `ltf_range_expansion_bonus_cap`
- Peer confirmation:
  - `min_peer_agreement`, `min_peer_score`
- Macro confirmation:
  - `enable_macro_confirmation`, `require_macro_agreement_count`, `dollar_symbol`, `bond_symbol`, `volatility_symbol`
- Level scoring detail:
  - `level_round_number_tolerance_pct`
- Strong-setup runner / ladder logic:
  - `strong_setup_runner_enabled`, `strong_setup_min_ltf_score`, `strong_setup_min_level_score`, `strong_setup_min_peer_score`, `strong_setup_min_htf_vote_edge`, `strong_setup_target_level_offset`
  - When `risk.trade_management_mode: adaptive_ladder` is active, this strategy stores rung metadata at entry and promotes targets one rung at a time while ratcheting stops behind defended S/R levels/zones. Non-ladder strategies safely fall back to adaptive management.

Also uses these shared stock groups:

- force-flatten
- stock FVG confluence
- adaptive stock trade management

### `peer_confirmed_key_levels_1m`

Purpose: 1-minute LTF peer-confirmed HTF key-level/zone strategy variant that keeps the same HTF map and peer/macro confirmation framework as `peer_confirmed_key_levels`, but is now tuned as a compromise between aggressive and balanced confirmation so entries can form earlier without using the older looser gates.

Default windows:

- `entry_windows`: `[['07:05', '15:40']]`
- `management_windows`: `[['07:00', '15:58']]`
- `screener_windows`: `[['07:00', '15:40']]`

Key differences vs the 5-minute base strategy:

- `ltf_minutes: 1`
- deeper LTF warmup with `min_bars: 90` and `min_ltf_bars: 45`
- compromise 1-minute LTF gates that are still faster than the 5-minute base but no longer use the older aggressive thresholds: `min_level_score: 2.5`, `min_rr: 1.6`, `min_peer_agreement: 2`, `min_peer_score: 2`
- tighter LTF zone sizing and slightly faster adaptive management to suit 1-minute execution while keeping confirmation more balanced
- heavier weighting on LTF FVG participation while still retaining the HTF map and macro confirmation checks
- inherits the base strategy's capped LTF-quality bonus layer so clean 1-minute reclaims / rejects can outrank weaker touches without raising `min_ltf_score`

Use `configs/config.peer_confirmed_key_levels_1m.yaml` for the shipped full preset.

### `peer_confirmed_htf_pivots`

Purpose: trade around HTF support/resistance pivot battlegrounds instead of generic HTF key-level votes. The strategy can enter in reclaim, rejection, or continuation mode, but it is now explicitly tuned as an S/R scalp strategy that prefers longs around support, shorts around resistance, and uses the next opposing S/R level as the first target reference.

Default windows:

- `entry_windows`: `[['09:35', '11:15'], ['13:00', '14:45']]`
- `management_windows`: `[['09:01', '15:55']]`
- `screener_windows`: `[['09:01', '11:25'], ['12:45', '15:55']]`

Strategy-specific knobs:

- Universe and HTF pivot map:
  - `tradable`, `peers`
  - `htf_minutes`, `htf_lookback_days`, `htf_pivot_span`, `htf_max_levels_per_side`, `htf_atr_tolerance_mult`, `htf_pct_tolerance`, `htf_stop_buffer_atr_mult`, `htf_ema_fast_span`, `htf_ema_slow_span`
- Trigger frame and warmup:
  - `ltf_minutes`, `min_bars`, `min_ltf_bars`
- Entry-family selection:
  - `entry_family` with `auto`, `pivot_reclaim`, `pivot_rejection`, and `pivot_continuation`
- Regime / trigger scoring:
  - `min_regime_score`, `min_ltf_score`, `min_total_score`, `min_peer_agreement`, `min_peer_score`
  - `enable_macro_confirmation`, `require_macro_agreement_count`, `dollar_symbol`, `bond_symbol`, `volatility_symbol`
- Pivot-zone sizing and family detail:
  - `pivot_zone_atr_mult`, `pivot_zone_pct`
  - `pivot_reclaim_buffer_pct`, `pivot_reclaim_zone_frac`
  - `pivot_rejection_min_wick_frac`, `pivot_rejection_allows_neutral_ltf_structure`
  - `pivot_continuation_breakout_buffer_pct`, `pivot_continuation_interaction_lookback_bars`, `pivot_continuation_max_distance_atr`
- Trigger quality and anti-chase:
  - `min_ltf_close_position`, `min_ltf_volume_ratio`, `min_adx14`
  - `max_reclaim_distance_from_pivot_atr`, `max_rejection_distance_from_pivot_atr`, `max_continuation_distance_from_pivot_atr`
  - `entry_exhaustion_filter_enabled`, `max_entry_vwap_extension_atr`, `max_entry_ema9_extension_atr`, `max_entry_bar_range_atr`, `max_entry_upper_wick_frac`, `max_entry_lower_wick_frac`
  - `use_sr_veto` (disabled by default so the strategy stays anchored to the HTF pivot model rather than generic S/R vetoes)
- R:R and adaptive management:
  - `min_rr`, `target_rr`, `runner_target_rr`, `stop_buffer_atr_mult`
  - `strong_setup_runner_enabled`, `adaptive_breakeven_rr`, `adaptive_profit_lock_rr`, `adaptive_profit_lock_stop_rr`, `adaptive_runner_trigger_rr`
- Context overlays:
  - `htf_fvg_entry_weight`, `ltf_fvg_entry_weight`, `opposing_fvg_entry_penalty_mult`, `fvg_runner_rr_bonus`

Also uses these shared stock groups:

- force-flatten
- stock FVG confluence
- adaptive stock trade management

### `top_tier_adaptive`

Purpose: multi-regime adaptive strategy for a fixed universe of 23 top-tier liquid stocks across six Tier 1 GICS sectors: Technology (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, INTC, AMD, AVGO, TSM, CRM), Consumer Discretionary (AMZN, TSLA, HD, LOW, UBER), Communication Services (GOOG, META, NFLX, RBLX, TMUS), Financials (JPM, GS, V), Healthcare (LLY), Consumer Staples (COST). Six regimes compete in a flat score-ordered build queue: trend, pullback, range, vol_squeeze, momentum, sr_scalp — each independently togglable via `disable_*_regime` knobs.

Default windows:

- `entry_windows`: `[["09:35", "15:00"]]`
- `management_windows`: `[["09:30", "15:55"]]`
- `screener_windows`: `[["09:30", "15:00"]]`

Strategy-specific knobs:

- `tradable`: the fixed list of symbols to trade.
- `index_symbols`: index ETFs streamed for directional confirmation. The default ships with the canonical SPDR Select Sector ETFs that match the default tradable universe's GICS sectors (XLK / XLC / XLY / XLF / XLV / XLP). Pair with `sector_index_map` (below) to control which ETFs confirm which symbols.
- `sector_index_map`: per-sector mapping from GICS sector name (matches `sector_groups` keys) → list of index ETFs to consult when confirming trades on symbols in that sector. Default: each sector maps to its canonical SPDR Select Sector ETF (`tech: [XLK]`, `energy: [XLE]`, ...). Materials defaults to `[XLB, GDX, COPX]` because XLB is dominated by chemicals (LIN/SHW/APD/ECL) — pure miners (NEM gold / FCX copper) correlate more with GDX/COPX. OR semantics across the list: a NEM LONG passes when GDX is bullish even if XLB is flat. When the map is omitted entirely, the bot falls back to OR-ing across the entire `index_symbols` list (legacy behavior).
- `require_index_confirmation`: gate trend/pullback/vol_squeeze/momentum entries on index agreement. Range and sr_scalp are exempt (mean-reversion theses).
- `min_trend_score` / `min_pullback_score` / `min_range_score` / `min_vol_squeeze_score` / `min_momentum_score` / `min_sr_scalp_score`: minimum regime score to qualify.
- `min_pullback_trend_score`: minimum trend score required before pullback scoring begins.
- `min_score_gap`: minimum gap between the winning and runner-up regime (unused as of the 2026-05-12 flat-build-queue refactor; retained for backwards compat).
- `trend_target_rr` / `pullback_target_rr` / `range_target_rr` / `vol_squeeze_target_rr` / `momentum_target_rr`: initial R:R targets per regime. Sr_scalp has no R:R target — its target is the inner edge of the opposite HTF zone.
- `sr_scalp_min_distance_pct` / `sr_scalp_min_distance_atr`: HTF zone-gap floors for the sr_scalp regime (defaults `0.008` = 0.8% and `2.5` = 2.5x ATR). The inner gap between HS and HR zones must clear BOTH (max wins).
- `sr_scalp_max_distance_from_zone_atr`: sr_scalp proximity gate — close must be inside the entry-side zone OR within this multiple of ATR of its inner edge (default `0.5`).
- `orb_end_time` / `midday_start_time` / `midday_end_time` / `afternoon_start_time` / `no_new_entries_after`: time-of-day regime window boundaries (all six regimes use these — no hard-coded times).
- `disable_trend_regime` / `disable_pullback_regime` / `disable_range_regime` / `disable_vol_squeeze_regime` / `disable_momentum_regime` / `disable_sr_scalp_regime`: per-regime opt-out flags (all default `false`).
- `disable_orb_window`: whole-window opt-out for the 09:35 → `orb_end_time` ORB window (default `false`). Different from `orb_bypass_*` flags which loosen filters within the window — this skips it entirely.
- `sector_groups`: GICS sector groupings for the concentration guard.
- `max_same_sector_same_direction`: max same-direction positions per sector.

Also uses these shared stock groups:

- force-flatten (configurable per side)
- entry exhaustion filters
- stock FVG confluence
- adaptive stock trade management
- chart pattern entry/exit gates
- market structure entry/exit gates
- S/R entry/exit gates and level refinement

### `zero_dte_etf_options`

Purpose: 0DTE ETF strategy that can trade debit spreads and, when enabled, midday credit spreads.

Default windows:

- `entry_windows`: `[['09:40', '14:20']]`
- `management_windows`: `[['09:30', '15:15']]`
- `screener_windows`: `[['09:35', '14:20']]`

Special behavior:

- `options.styles` decides which spread styles are allowed:
  - `orb_debit_spread`
  - `trend_debit_spread`
  - `midday_credit_spread`
- `credit_start_time` / `credit_end_time` are used only by this spread strategy.

### `zero_dte_etf_long_options`

Purpose: 0DTE ETF strategy that buys a single long call or long put and never sells naked premium or opens a spread.

Default windows:

- `entry_windows`: `[['09:40', '14:10']]`
- `management_windows`: `[['09:30', '15:20']]`
- `screener_windows`: `[['09:35', '14:10']]`

Long-option-only parameters:

- `options.styles` can selectively enable `orb_long_option` and `trend_long_option`.
- `long_option_min_trend_score`: stricter trend-score threshold before buying the option.
- `long_option_min_score_gap`: stricter score-gap requirement before buying the option.
- `long_option_max_vwap_extension_pct`: max extension from VWAP before the long option is considered too late.
- `long_option_max_ema_gap_pct`: max EMA gap before the long option is considered too extended.
- `long_option_max_ret5` / `long_option_max_ret15`: short-horizon spike filters that reduce chase entries.

## `pairs` block

Used only by `pairs_residual`.

Each row supports:

- `symbol`: primary tradable symbol
- `reference`: comparison symbol used to compute residual divergence
- `side_preference`: `long`, `short`, or `both`
- `sector`: optional label only
- `industry`: optional label only

Changing `side_preference` restricts the directions that pair may trade without changing the rest of the strategy logic.

The shipped `configs/config.pairs_residual.yaml` preset now includes two editable example pairs so the strategy is immediately runnable. Replace those examples with the pairs you actually want to trade.

## Which top-level blocks matter to which strategies

- All strategies use: `strategy`, `schwab`, `risk`, `runtime`, `paper`, `dashboard`, and `execution`.
- Stock strategies also use: `tradingview`, `candles`, `chart_patterns`, `support_resistance`, `technical_levels`, `shared_entry`, `shared_exit`, and their own `strategies.<name>` params from the selected top-level config file.
- `pairs_residual` also uses: `pairs`.
- Option strategies also use: `options`, `support_resistance`, `shared_entry`, and their own `strategies.<name>` params from the selected top-level config file.

## Practical tuning notes

- `risk.trade_management_mode: adaptive_ladder` is now the safe default recommendation. Ladder-aware strategies opt in via metadata; strategies without ladder metadata automatically behave like normal adaptive management.
- If you want fewer chase entries, tighten the anti-chase thresholds before tightening the whole strategy universe.
- If you want more trade frequency, loosen the screener/liquidity filters before loosening stop logic.
- If you want stronger FVG influence, raise the strategy's FVG weights instead of turning more global filters on.
- If you want the dashboard lighter, turn off the heavier chart overlays before reducing `max_bars`.


## Strategy-specific top-level presets

Prebuilt top-level presets are included under `configs/config.<strategy>.yaml` for every strategy. Each preset is intended to be the complete runtime source of truth for that strategy, while manifests remain the built-in fallback defaults.

Shipped preset files:

| `configs/config.peer_confirmed_key_levels.yaml` | `peer_confirmed_key_levels`           |
| `configs/config.peer_confirmed_key_levels_1m.yaml` | `peer_confirmed_key_levels_1m`     |
| `configs/config.peer_confirmed_trend_continuation.yaml` | `peer_confirmed_trend_continuation` |
| `configs/config.peer_confirmed_htf_pivots.yaml` | `peer_confirmed_htf_pivots`           |
| `configs/config.top_tier_adaptive.yaml`         | `top_tier_adaptive`                   |
| `configs/config.zero_dte_etf_options.yaml`      | `zero_dte_etf_options`                |
| `configs/config.zero_dte_etf_long_options.yaml` | `zero_dte_etf_long_options`           |

Plus two non-strategy files:

- `configs/config.example.yaml` — canonical full-config template, used as the scaffold base by `scripts/scaffold_strategy_plugin.py`.
- `configs/config.yaml` — the default file `main.py` loads when `--config` is omitted.

To run a shipped preset:

```bash
python main.py --config configs/config.<strategy>.yaml --strategy <strategy>
```
